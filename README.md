# python_blockchain
Small blockchain project written in python


This is a small blockchain written in python in which 3 wallets are created, WalletA creates and signs a transaction to WalletB, WalletB signs a new transaction to WalletA which sends funds to WalletC.

Each transaction is mined into a block applying sha256 algorithm.

For each wallet a public and a private key are created using an elliptic curve cryptography algorithm.
